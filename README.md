# Getting Started with Create React App

This project focus on learning the basic concepts of React and Redux.
1. Class components
2. Functional components
3. Redux for maintaining global state of application
4. Thunk
5. Logger
6. Lazy loading which helps in code splitting as well
7. Usage of ref keyword
8. Pagination
9. Reusable components
10. Unit testing with Enzyme and Jest
11. Axios for async calls

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the required packages for the application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
